# Eye Movement
## Eyes Exercise
<p> The purpose of this exercise was to practice key built-in Javascript concepts such as onmousemove, getElementsByClassName(), the hirearchy and importance of divs, the for loop, and seperating classes in the CSS. </p>
<p2> For a litle extra flavor, I stylized the pupils to a popular anime reference, the sharingan from "Naruto." </p2>

### Roadmap of Future Improvements
<p3> The CSS can be taken even further. I could customize the shape of each eyeball, making it less like a generic almond. </p3>
